Megamind Essay
The idea of good and evil in society is a fundamental idea to humanity and is the basis of many systems in society such as the legal system which punishes what the leaders of the society or the members of society in a democracy thinks of what is evil or bad. The movie Megamind, directed by Tom McGrath, 2010 is a movie which shows the protagonist, an alien who gets sent to earth, reminiscent of superman, and lands into a prison and is taught immoral thing by the prisoners. Them Megamind grows up to discover that the only thing he is good at is being bad and decides that he will dedicate his life to doing just that; being bad. This decision is influenced by his failure at many passsions he has when comparing him to to Megamind's counterpart, Metroman, who is very good and the hero of the city. Next Megamind then spends many years trying to defeat Metroman in any way he can and finally "succeeds". 

Evil in a biblical context can be defined as something or someone who undermines God's creation or violates one of the bibles rules. Megamind commits many evil acts using his free will  including but not limited to, destroying public property, attempting to kill Metroman, kidnapping Roxanne on multiple occasions, overthrowing the government, breaking prisoners out of prison and deceiving many people to escape prisen, by impersonating others. Megamind has purposely committed many sins at this point of the movie. The reasoning behind Megamind choosing evil at an early age is the indoctrination by the prisoners teaching baby Megamind that good is evil and what is evil is good. This is reason is valid due to small children having very little original ideas and generally getting their morality from there carers and the people around them. Megamind then continues to evil acts with his freewill in his adulthood which is clearly a against God.


Megamind slowly becomes a better person by performing acts of good. Roxanne mostly influences these decisions through Megamind's relationship with her while Megamind is impersonating Bernard . The introduction of Megamind Bernard is the turning point where Megamind starts use his free will to perform good acts such as cleaning up the city even though this is to prepare for the fight for with that main antagonist Tighten. The other influence on Megamind is Tighten, the character who was supposed to be a hero and Megamind's enemy but turned out to be a villain and forcing Megamind to deafeat him. This act of Megamind defeating the villain inspires Megamind and changes Megamind and he does an act of good which makes Megamind see that he does not want to be evil and then Megamind rectifies all acts of evil he has done on the city. 

The importance of forgiveness on the outcome of the movie Megamind is very significant as it is the deciding factor to what happens to Megamind in the end of the film. The quote "Free will has been God's greatest and most risky gift to humanity." is very applicable with retrospect of the film. The quote is accurate as free will is an amazing gift as it lets us be free and make our own decisions but also allows us to make very evil decisions causing the destruction of God's creation and the suffering of others.  This is evident in the movie when Megamind uses his freewill to do acts of act of evil and at the end of the film change his ways and instead do acts of good.

At the end of the film the society forgives Megamind of the evil acts and he becomes the hero of the city. This is morally questionable as he was a prisoner and still technically has many life sentences and would have spent the rest of his life in prison if he was not forgiven. The forgiveness of Megamind's sins is an important part of the story and is the crux of the end of the film. It is a message that can apply to all Christians of the importance of forgiveness.
