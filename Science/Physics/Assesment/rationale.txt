Energy is the capacity to do work (Britannica, 2021). Types of energy present during the experiment included gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, sound energy and heat energy. Gravitational potential energy is defined as mass multiplied by gravitational field multiplied by height. Increasing any of the values will increase the total gravitational potential energy. In the experiment the mass and gravitational field are constant with the height of the ramp increasing. During the experiment this potential energy is converted to kinetic energy heat and sound energy. 

Kinetic energy is the push and pull force on object and is the force of motion. It is the most interacted with energy and is essential to everything we as humans can do. Kinetic energy can be transformed from other types of energy including heat, electricity and gravitational potential energy. It can also be transferred to and from objects when colliding. Kinetic energy also commonly has by-products such as heat, and sound caused by friction in either other surfaces or air. This means that kinetic energy is lost when objects move.
