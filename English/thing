boys will be bugs by cavetown is a song about an edgy 14 year old boy who thinks he a strong person when infact he is quite odd and talks to bugs. The song shows themes
 of confustion but is mostly a neutral tone and doesn't discuss very hard topics as it is from the postion of a 14 year old boy. The boy in the song is shown to be inte
rested in bugs and is generally antisocial as shown when it states that his only friends are bugs. The song plays with swapping to a sort of heinsight in some parts whe
n it says "I'm a dumb teen boy" which is clearly not from the perspective of a 14 year old and is most likely a future self looking back.
