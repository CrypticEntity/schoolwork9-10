An eating dinner with his family when noise outside
An is scared due to what happened to his wife before
An peaks out the window
An sees the destruction of his garden and the ute parked in garden
An turns on the light and goes outside
An asks what they are doing, acting calm
An walks down steps while continue garden destruction
An gets hit, alot
An goes to the ground
Charlie screams for his parents
Charlie's dad runs at them, charlie follows
An's wife screams, holds jefferey
An gets bashed again, spitted on
An gets called red rat
Charlie'd dad tackles one of them and fights them off An
An crawls back to the steps of his house and wheezes
Dog barks in ute
